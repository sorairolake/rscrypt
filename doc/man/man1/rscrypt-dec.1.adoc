== NAME

rscrypt-dec - decrypt files

== SYNOPSIS

*rscrypt dec* [_OPTION_]... _INFILE_ [_OUTFILE_]

== DESCRIPTION

This command decrypt files.

== POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

_INFILE_::

  Input file.
  If "-" is specified, data will be read from stdin.

_OUTFILE_::

  Output file.
  If _OUTFILE_ is not specified, the result will be write to stdout.

== OPTIONS

*-f*, *--force*::

  Force the decryption to proceed even if it requires an excessive amount of
  resources.

*-M*, *--max-memory* _BYTES_::

  Use at most the specified bytes of RAM to compute the derived key.
  _BYTES_ can also be provided as bytes with the unit symbol (such as MiB and
  GB).
  _BYTES_ should be between 1 MiB and 16 EiB.

*-m*, *--max-memory-fraction* _RATE_::

  Use at most the specified fraction of the available RAM to compute the
  derived key.
  _RATE_ can be provided as a decimal or a fraction.
  _RATE_ should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to *0.5*.
  Default is 0.5.

*-t*, *--max-time* _DURATION_::

  Use at most the specified duration of CPU time to compute the derived key.
  Default is 300 seconds.

*--passphrase-from-tty*::

  Read the password from /dev/tty.
  This is the default behavior.

*--passphrase-from-stdin*::

  Read the password from stdin.

*--passphrase-from-env* _VAR_::

  Read the password from the environment variable.
  Note that storing a password in an environment variable can be a security
  risk.

*--passphrase-from-file* _FILE_::

  Read the password from the file.
  Note that storing a password in a file can be a security risk.

*-v*, *--verbose*::

  Print encryption parameters and resource limits.

*-h*, *--help*::

  Print help information.

*-V*, *--version*::

  Print version information.
